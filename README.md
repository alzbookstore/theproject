==========

This contains a sample of scripts used for the beginnings of an interactive voice interface.
There are more in use in my project than shown here, but it will updated to include comprehensive workflows in time.

The first document is the script for the Alarm.
This is triggered by a calendar event, "Alarm" and the calendar event is setup via voice control.
I will upload more relevant scripts soon, but several of them are interactive and use callbacks to others.

The end goal of this project is working toward a complete voice interface.
Initially, it will interface with home automation devices, running scenes, and basic information/search retrieval and document interaction.
Next, it will include deep diving into system files, preferences, programming, mass use of templates for projects, etc.
